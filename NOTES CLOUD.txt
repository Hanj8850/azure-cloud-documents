AD MANAGE IDENTITY AND GOVERNANCE IN AZURE. IT PROVIDES SSO.IF THERE IS NO AZURE AD THEN WE WOULD HAVE TO CREATE MULTIPLE IDS FOR SINGLE USER.IT IS VERY HECTIC TASK TO MANAGE ALL THE IDENTITIES
.THIS IS VERY BIG TASK TO HANDLE ALL THE USERNAME AND PASSWORD AND TO STORE THEM .BUT IF AZURE AD IS  THERE THEN AD PROVIDES SSO.SO NEED NOT TO CREATE MULTIPLE IDS FOR A 
SINGLE  USER.AD DOES GOVERNANCE IN AZURE.GENERATE ALL KIND OF LOGS AND GIVES ROLL TO USER AS PER NEEDED.



VNET=VNET IS A FUNDAMENTAL BUILDING BLOCK FOR PRIVATE NETWORK .IT PROVIDES SECURITY TO SUBNET . SUBNETS TAKE IPS FROM VNET.FIREWALL IS OUTER LAYER OF SECURITY OF VNET.
NSG CONTROLLS INBOUND AND OUTBOUND CONNECTION OF VNET.VNET PROVIDES PRIVATE NETWORK FOR DATA SECURITY.


SUBNET= SUBNET IS A LOGICAL DIVISION  OF VNET. SUBNET TAKES IPS FROM VNET.SUBNET HANDLES ALL THE DEPLOYMENTS.WE CAN DEPLOY VM IN SUBNET.VNET PROVIDE PROTECTION TO SUBNET.
WE CAN ASSOCIATE SUBNET TO NSG FOR INBOUND AND OUTBOUND CONTROLL.WE CAN CREATE MULTIPLE SUBNETS IN  A SINGLE VNET.

STORAGE HAS FOUR TYPES FOR KEEP REPLICAS OF DATA

LRS= LOCAL REDUNDANT STORAGE . THREE REPLICAS IN A HOME DATA CENTER.
ZRS= ZONE REDUNDANT STORAGE . IT REPLICATES THREE REPLICATION WITHIN THREE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT DATACENTERS IN SAME REGION.
GRS= GEO REDUNDANT STORAGE . THREE REPLICAS IN A HOME DATA CENTER AND THREE REPLICA WILL BE AVAILABLE IN DIFFERENT REGION WITHIN SAME DATACENTER.
GZRS= GEO ZONE REDUNDANT STORAGE . IT REPLICATES THREE REPLICATION WITHIN THREE DIFFERENT DIFFERENT DATACENTERS IN SAME REGION.THREE REPLICAS IN A HOME DATA CENTER.


GRS = LRS + LRS
GZRS = ZRS = LRS


FIREWALL=
